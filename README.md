# Merge sort

The divide and conquer sorting algorithm. The `#merge_sort` method has been extended to the Array class, allowing you to use merge_sort on any array. Specs and benchmarkings are also included.

The alogorithm first splits the array into the smallest arrays possible, sorts the numbers in those small arrays, and starts to merge them together, with the smaller numbers being merged first. It does this until all the small arrays becomes one large array and fully sorted.

## Tests and Benchmarks
